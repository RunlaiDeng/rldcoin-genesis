# Generic regional ledger candidate

An incompatible, bounded Rust implementation for white paper 1.11's onward and
return value transitions. It runs three native regional ledger stores, replays
signed owner operations and mined blocks, and uses explicitly installed unanimous
checkpoints. **Public fixture keys, no monetary value, no mainnet mode.**

The existing source/destination nodes and their signed genesis commitments are
unchanged. This supplemental candidate is separately built and started. It is
not a qualified regional consensus protocol or a migration path.

This source revision adds native random encrypted owner keys, complete encrypted owner-journal backup/fresh-directory restore, and local wallet backup controls. It retains interactive group proposal construction with fixed expiry across later owner reviews. It retains the loopback wallet interface with explicit native review, persisted signing/recovery, only-owned-input reservations and separate recipient stages. It retains default TLS relay, group approvals, [durable signer locks and joint validator epochs](../../docs/research/REGIONAL_SIGNER_EPOCHS_V1.md) and incident/quarantine policy. It creates a new fixture root; earlier source/report packages remain historical.

## Reproduce

Rust 1.98 or later is required. From the exact source tree:

```sh
cargo test --locked --manifest-path tools/regional-ledger/Cargo.toml
cargo clippy --locked --manifest-path tools/regional-ledger/Cargo.toml --all-targets -- -D warnings
cargo build --locked --manifest-path tools/regional-ledger/Cargo.toml --bins
tools/regional-ledger/target/debug/fixture-campaign /absolute/NEW-fixture-directory
```

The campaign starts a separate native CLI process for every operation, using
three on-disk stores. It provides only Earth–Proxima and Proxima–Andromeda
contact transfers. Earth is not invoked while distant local payments and
onward exports execute. Each successful transition and evidence installation
replays all three stores and checks exact conservation. This is a ground
process/restart exercise, not elapsed years, independent owners or real links.

The report contains public currency/source commitments, export IDs, checks and
limitations. Node journals, contact files and other local state are not public
outputs. All signing seeds inside the campaign are deliberately public fixtures:
authority 1; initial validators 2–5, 22–25 and 42–45; new Earth validators 62–65; local owners/miner 10–14. All normal checkpoints use persisted native signer agents; the helper retains latest heads outside their directories. Adversarial conflict injection deliberately bypasses those agents with public fixture keys.

## Default network-node startup

After verifying and initializing a fixture ledger, ordinary startup enables
signed discovery and bounded relay in the same process lifecycle:

```sh
/absolute/rld-regional-ledger-candidate --dir /absolute/ledger --authority AUTHORITY_HEX --currency CURRENCY_HEX
```

A persistent, separate transport identity and queue are initialized or recovered
in the ledger's `transport/` directory. Without real neighbors the node waits;
there is no invented route, central registration or automatic mining reward.
Add authenticated adjacent contacts to `transport/config.json`, then
restart the same node. Alternatively provide `--mesh-config /absolute/config.json`.
Only local adjacent contacts are configured; distant routes are learned through
signed advertisements. A wallet-only client is not a full relay node.

Use `--transport-python /absolute/python` with the dependencies in
`tools/interstellar-mesh-requirements.txt`. The Rust launcher replaces itself
with the bounded Python contact runtime; native Rust replays and validates every
ledger application. Both sources must remain available in the build checkout.
`contact-node` remains a compatible explicit alias, but is not required.

Relay service requires no miner or signing key. An explicitly supplied
`--miner PUBLIC_KEY` additionally enables local import block production after
native evidence validation. Without it verified evidence stays pending until a
local block producer fulfills it; storage acknowledgments never credit value.
Normal checkpoints still require separately authorized native signer agents.

Each eligible neighboring path can carry the same signed packet ID, within
per-contact batch/byte bounds and signed hop limits. Permanent packet/import
deduplication preserves value when paths converge. New useful contacts can
extend reach or survive one relay loss; extra identities alone do not establish
consensus security. Full storage refuses new custody and retains existing data.
Default limits are 16 adjacent contacts, 64 learned nodes, 256 retained transport
messages/receipts, 64 MiB state, 16 hops and four application attempts per poll.
Qualified physical adapters, contact capacity and independent security qualification
remain separate gates.

## TLS 1.3 IPv4 ground contacts

Normal startup also opens a loopback listener on an automatically assigned port.
This listener and its outgoing TCP contacts now use TLS 1.3 by default; no
plaintext or older TLS fallback is attempted. The status includes its public
certificate SHA-256 and validity deadline. Independently exchange and pin both
the mesh identity and certificate hash for every adjacent peer before sending.
Use `--mesh-listen 127.0.0.1:PORT` for a stable local endpoint, or explicitly bind
an available IPv4 interface for an operator-configured network. No firewall,
public exposure or NAT traversal is configured automatically. Configure each
adjacent endpoint and independently pin its transport identity on both sides:

```json
{"contacts":[{"host":"127.0.0.1","peer":"PINNED_NEIGHBOR_NODE_HEX","port":39001,"tls_cert_sha256":"PINNED_CERTIFICATE_SHA256"}],"format":"RLD-CONTACT-MESH-V1","network":"CURRENCY_HEX","state":"/absolute/private/mesh"}
```

Addresses are literal IPv4 and ports are integers; no DNS, URLs or endpoints from
remote advertisements are followed. `tools/interstellar_tcp.py` uses bounded
length-prefixed canonical signed exchanges inside TLS. A signed fresh server
challenge authenticates its mesh identity and binds this connection. Each request
names its recipient, that challenge and a fresh client nonce; the signed reply
binds both nonces and the exact exchange hash. A captured request cannot be
replayed on a new connection to obtain returned evidence. Custody is
acknowledged only after complete verification and durable storage. A failed or
lost reply keeps the source evidence; duplicate delivery stays idempotent. Socket
waits hold no mesh lock. Persistent batch rotation gives later queued evidence a
turn even when early deliveries fail. Native Rust still determines every credit.

TLS uses a separate Ed25519 key and self-signed certificate committed together in
one owner-only, fsynced `tcp-tls.private.pem`; it never uses a wallet/finality key.
Certificate authentication checks the independently configured exact DER hash,
the exact mesh identity/network, self-signature and validity. Public CA/hostname
trust is not used. The signed connection challenge and request authenticate the
mesh peers after TLS; this is not TLS client-certificate authentication. Damaged,
symlinked, overly permissive or mismatched private material is retained and
refused. Restart preserves the certificate and key. New certificates last 90
days under the ground operator's UTC clock; expiry blocks new contacts, retaining
evidence and balances. Rotation, changed pins and recovery need independently
verified operator action; no silent trust update is performed. This policy does
not qualify stellar cryptographic horizons or delayed revocation.

At most two inbound workers and four outbound contacts per tick are admitted.
The outer wire frame is at most 20 MiB plus 4,096 bytes; its exchange remains
within 20 MiB. A three-second local attempt bounds ground connection waits;
it neither expires evidence nor refunds exports and is not a stellar RTT limit.
Local contact observations are process-local history, separate from advertised
routes, destination custody, native acceptance and spendability.

```sh
python3 -m unittest discover -s tools -p 'test_interstellar_*.py' -v
python3 tools/regional_contact_campaign.py --binary "$PWD/tools/regional-ledger/target/debug/rld-regional-ledger-candidate" --root /absolute/NEW-tcp-fixture --report /absolute/NEW-tcp-report.json --adapter tcp
```

The TCP campaign uses three actual native processes and loopback sockets with no
shared contact spools. Earth disconnects only after actual neighboring custody;
remote native imports, local payment and onward export then proceed without it.
A new return waits for restored contact. This same-host duplex adapter is signed
and TLS encrypted. Cross-host operation, independent cryptographic review,
one-way/radio/BPv7 links, contact schedules, hostile availability and physical routes remain
unqualified. Directory contacts remain available; standalone mesh `run` only
pumps those directories, while the normal native lifecycle runs both adapters.
For an explicitly selected ground experiment only, `--mesh-insecure-tcp` uses a
plaintext listener with unpinned TCP contacts and still requires signed connection
challenges. Pinned contacts cannot be used in that mode. It is never a fallback.

The 24 actual-socket checks include a transparent wire proxy, wrong/missing pins,
TLS downgrade/plaintext refusal, cross-connection replay, expiry and private
material failure, alongside the earlier relay/queue checks. Python's
[TLS API](https://docs.python.org/3.11/library/ssl.html) and cryptography's
[certificate API](https://cryptography.io/en/50.0.1/x509/reference/) provide the
underlying ground transport primitives; their use is not an independent review.

## CLI

Every invocation requires `--dir`, `--authority` and the exact `--currency` root.
A currency root is checked against the caller's trusted authority and the exact
build's implementation commitment. Region names alone cannot authorize a ledger.

- `init --bootstrap FILE --region LABEL`: verify an offline signed package and
  create an empty store in a new absolute directory.
- `status`: independently replay persisted state and return identity, local
  coins, maturity heights, permanent import IDs, export dependencies and finality.
- `wallet-init --owner PUBLIC_KEY --wallet-dir DIR`: create a new private,
  separately locked wallet journal; retain its returned head outside that directory.
- `wallet-view --wallet-dir DIR --expected-wallet-head HEAD`: report verified
  ledger amounts, currently available funds, reserved inputs and retained signed
  commands. A stale wallet head is rejected rather than displayed as available money.
- `wallet-prepare --file REQUEST --wallet-dir DIR --expected-wallet-head HEAD`:
  select owned eligible, unreserved inputs, calculate explicit change and return
  an unsigned draft plus its separate review commitment and wallet head.
- `wallet-sign --file REVIEWED_DRAFT --review COMMITMENT --key-file PRIVATE_FILE --wallet-dir DIR --expected-wallet-head HEAD`:
  recheck the exact local journal, incidents and draft under the ledger lock, then
  sign and validate using the actual native command rules, then durably record
  the exact command and reserve its inputs before returning any signature.
  The response's `commands` array is for a block producer; signing does not mine.
  Persist the returned new wallet head separately. Exact response-loss retries
  return the retained signature and head without reading a key or signing again.
- `wallet-recover --intent ID --wallet-dir DIR --expected-wallet-head HEAD`:
  recover an exact retained signed command with its current local inclusion state.
- `wallet-combine --file CONTRIBUTIONS`: combine one independently retained
  approval per actual input owner for the exact same intent. Return a command
  only after complete native authorization and current eligibility checks;
  this operation neither reads private keys nor changes wallet or ledger state.
- `wallet-receipt --file EXPECTATION`: verify the exact currency, source,
  destination, export ID, recipient and net amount against local evidence/import
  history. Report pending evidence, immature import, spendable original output,
  spent original output or quarantine separately. A spent output does not undo
  the import; its new change/payment is shown by `wallet-view`.
- `mine --miner PUBLIC_KEY [--commands FILE]`: verify signed commands, search for
  real fixture PoW and atomically commit one block.
- `statement`: output the actual local history and checkpoint signing statement.
- `finalize --file FILE`: check the active era's four ordered signatures and install
  the exact local checkpoint. Signatures are obtained separately.
- `signer-init --signer-dir DIR --key PUBLIC_KEY`: create a separate locked signer
  journal; retain its returned head outside that directory.
- `sign-checkpoint --signer-dir DIR --key-file FILE --expected-lock HEAD`: persist
  the exact local signing lock before returning an approval and next head.
- `propose-epoch --validators FILE`: construct an unsigned handoff from the exact
  installed closing tip to a different ordered four-key set.
- `sign-handoff --signer-dir DIR --key-file FILE --expected-lock HEAD --file FILE`:
  persist consent and seal the old era; collect approvals from all old/new keys.
- `install-epoch --file FILE`: verify joint consent and install a durable era event.
- `signer-status --signer-dir DIR`: replay local signer state; the displayed head
  is not an independent monotonic rollback anchor.
- `incident --file FILE`: validate and retain an authenticated conflicting
  checkpoint pair without adopting either branch.
- `incidents`: export retained proofs for the next reachable neighbor.
- `recover-incident --file FILE`: restore exactly a guard/index-pinned proof;
  preserve damaged bytes and all quarantines.
- `proof`: output the retained signed checkpoint dependency archive; incident proofs are exported separately.
- `evidence --file FILE`: fully verify and atomically save an archive. This
  installs evidence only; it does not import value or alter local balances.

An authenticated conflict may be retained even while its accompanying value
archive is rejected; no value branch is adopted. At most 16 incident proofs are
retained separately. The persistent guard refuses restart when an observed proof
is missing or capacity prevents retaining it.

A proof archive's order is causal: previous checkpoints and import dependencies
must precede consumers. An incomplete or incompatible contact exchange is
rejected as a whole; the input file is never deleted. A later valid evidence
exchange may be supplied after the missing dependencies arrive.

## Local wallet interface

`wallet-app` is a wallet-only local client; ordinary full-node startup continues
its default relay lifecycle. It launches the supplemental Python bridge and
static browser UI, using native Rust for every view, review, signature, receipt,
combination and explicitly configured local block submission:

```sh
/absolute/rld-regional-ledger-candidate --dir /absolute/ledger --authority AUTHORITY_HEX --currency CURRENCY_HEX --transport-python /absolute/python wallet-app --wallet-dir /absolute/private-wallet --head-dir /absolute/separate-caller-head --owner OWNER_HEX --key-file /absolute/private-key.json
```

For an existing wallet, supply its separately retained latest
`--expected-wallet-head HEAD` on first client initialization. The caller-head
directory must be separate from the wallet directory. Optional `--miner PUBLIC_KEY`
explicitly enables ground local block submission; signing by itself never mines.
Without a key file the client is read-only for new signatures. Private fixture
key provisioning is separate; encrypted key creation, backup and hardware
custody are not implemented in this interface.

The startup URL contains a private, one-hour session capability in its fragment.
Use it only on this computer; the page immediately removes the fragment. No
external assets, browser key upload or arbitrary command/file-path API exists.
The server binds literal 127.0.0.1 only, checks the exact Host and POST Origin,
requires the capability, rejects duplicate JSON and framing fields, and sends
no-store/no-referrer/content-type/CSP protections. Input has a three-second
absolute read deadline and 2 MiB body bound; responses are at most 8 MiB.
One request is handled at a time; hostile local availability remains unqualified.
A new startup rotates the capability. Session/review expiry never deletes a
native signature, releases an input reservation or refunds an included export.

The page exposes available local and onward-export budgets after reservations,
immature and quarantined amounts, complete review of inputs/owners/refunds/fees,
local inclusion, recognized local export checkpoint and independently verified
recipient import/maturity. Known conflicts remain visible. Discovery, candidate
routes and custody are displayed as separate historical transport observations;
a saved process report is not proof of current liveness or destination credit.
Group proposals and individual signatures can be carried as bounded JSON files.
The client supports interactive proposal construction, separate owner review,
signature recovery and complete combination. Load 2-16 exact participant keys,
select up to 16 current native inputs and explicitly allocate every local payment
and refund. Peer private reservations are unknown. Amounts must balance exactly;
there is no automatic group change. Download the unsigned proposal from its
review screen; each owner independently imports and reviews it before signing.

`RLD-REGIONAL-GROUP-PROPOSAL-V1` binds the currency, region, exact intent ID and
full request, including one absolute `valid_through` height. Later owners preserve
that height instead of extending expiry or signing a different intent as the
local chain advances. A stale selection requires reloading inputs; a proposal
whose fixed expiry is past, altered or more than 32 local blocks ahead is refused.
`wallet-coins --owner SORTED_OWNER_HEX...` reads only public native ledger
ownership/eligibility; it opens no peer wallet and infers no peer reservations.

Before a clicked signing operation, the client durably saves its exact pending
review. After native signature persistence, it advances its separately retained
caller head before releasing the response. On restart, native `wallet-sign
--recover-only` can return an exact existing approval but cannot first-sign,
even with a key file supplied. If no new approval exists and native replay proves
the old head unchanged, the pending review is cleared and a new explicit review
is required. Ambiguity, corruption and persistence failure preserve records and
refuse further signing until reconciliation. A surviving client head rejects an
old wallet backup. Rolling back all local state together, cross-device coordination,
independent monotonic anchors, encrypted custody and reorganization remain unqualified.

## Wallet request and review

The current native wallet interface is a verified command layer with persisted
signed-intent reservations; the complete wallet UI, device recovery and external rollback
protection remain mandatory work. Single-owner requests select their own inputs
and automatic change; group requests use independent owner reviews and signatures.
Amounts below are integer runlai strings, never floating point or RLD decimals.

```json
{"owner":"OWNER_PUBLIC_KEY","inputs":null,"outputs":[{"owner":"RECIPIENT_PUBLIC_KEY","amount":"30"}],"remote":null,"fee":"1","valid_for_blocks":8}
```

For a remote payment, `remote` is
`{"destination":"EXACT_ADMITTED_REGION_ID","recipient":{"owner":"RECIPIENT_PUBLIC_KEY","amount":"80"},"destination_fee":"2"}`.
The remote amount is the gross source debit; the destination recipient gets
gross minus destination fee. Local fee, explicit outputs and change also count
in source conservation. Only finalized, mature, unaffected inputs are selected
for export; local spending does not require finality of already mature outputs.
Optional `inputs` permits at most 16 ordered unique IDs owned by this wallet.

Save the exact `wallet-prepare` response for review. The response exposes the
intent ID, input total, change, recipients, fees, domains and a local state pin.
Retain the displayed `review_commitment` separately and pass it to `wallet-sign`.
Do not derive approval from an untrusted replacement draft. Any ledger, evidence,
epoch or incident change requires a new preparation and review. A private key file
has shape `{"secret_key":"64_HEX_SEED"}` and owner-only file permissions;
symlinked, public-readable and mismatched keys are rejected. Keys never appear
in drafts or signed commands. The node revalidates commands again at inclusion.
No remote endpoint or returned transport receipt is required for local signing.

For a group, add `participants` containing all 2–16 actual input owners in
strictly sorted order, and explicitly name 1–16 sorted, unique input IDs and
every local payment/refund output. Their exact total must equal local outputs,
local fee and any gross remote payment. No automatic group change is assigned
to one participant. Each owner uses their own `owner` request value, wallet
directory, separately retained latest wallet head and private key; all other
intent fields must agree. The draft displays each input's native owner and
amount, all recipients/refunds, fees, domains and expiry for independent review.

Each `wallet-sign` durably retains only that owner's partial approval and reserves
only their inputs. Its `required_owners` lists the actual owner set;
`retained_approvals_complete=false` describes this wallet's retained partial
command, including after a combined command is included. It does not report
whether other owners have signed elsewhere. A partial command cannot form or
enter a block. Recover each owner's contribution without a private key using
`wallet-recover`, collect the single command from each response into a JSON
array, and pass it to `wallet-combine`. The combiner rejects missing, duplicate,
foreign, forged or differing intent approvals, and rechecks native eligibility
including expiry, spent inputs and quarantine. Returned `complete_owner_authorization`
means current native command authorization; inclusion still requires a block.

If a peer input is consumed by another local command, the whole old group intent
becomes impossible and each wallet releases its own still-unspent reservation.
Only native pre-inclusion expiry also frees unincluded reservations; signatures
remain retained. Inclusion releases reservations without refunding any remote
debit. Restarts replay actual input ownership and amounts at each retained
signing observation, preserving review descriptions after inputs are spent.
This is append-only fixture recovery; reorganization, cross-device custody,
independent rollback protection and complete wallet UI remain unqualified.

Receipt expectations have shape
`{"currency":"CURRENCY_ID","source":"SOURCE_REGION_ID","destination":"LOCAL_REGION_ID","export":"EXPORT_ID","recipient":"RECIPIENT_PUBLIC_KEY","net_amount":"78"}`.
Missing independently verified evidence returns an error; a transport receipt
alone cannot create a wallet credit. Local maturity and onward-export finality
remain separate. These local observations are not external monotonic anchors;
restoring all node state can still defeat local rollback detection.

## Pending commands and recovery

Every wallet operation checks the caller's separately retained latest wallet
head. The native CLI takes the ledger lock before the wallet lock. A reviewed
signature is saved with its command, inputs, observation and predecessor head
using private files, fsync and atomic replacement before release. Reopening
recovers a complete interrupted replacement only when it is one exact verified
extension; partial or incompatible bytes remain preserved and fail closed.
An exact lost-response retry or `wallet-recover` uses the retained signature.

`available` excludes inputs of `SIGNED_PENDING_INCLUSION` commands; `ledger.spendable`
is the raw verified ledger amount and is not the wallet's new-payment budget.
Local inclusion changes the record to `INCLUDED_IN_LOCAL_LEDGER`. If another local
command consumes an input, the old command can no longer execute and becomes
`INPUTS_CONSUMED_BY_OTHER_LOCAL_COMMAND`. Only an unincluded command whose next
possible local block is beyond `valid_through` becomes `EXPIRED_BEFORE_INCLUSION`.
The chain head must be at least `valid_through`; wall time, courier deletion,
transport receipts and remote silence never release a reservation.

This expiry applies to an owner command not yet debited into the ledger. An
already included export remains deducted forever under these rules; releasing
its wallet reservation neither refunds the export nor recreates any input.
Native inclusion still rechecks unspent inputs, signatures and height expiry.
All signed records remain retained, including included and expired commands.
At 128 records or 8 MiB the wallet refuses new signatures rather than pruning.

A surviving latest wallet head rejects a restored older wallet directory.
Retained creation/signing observations also reject older/forked node prefixes,
era/finality regression and disappearance of incidents observed at those points.
Read-only queries do not themselves persist new observation anchors. Joint
rollback of the wallet, ledger and every external head, copied-key bypass and
independent monotonic/device recovery remain unqualified. These rules rely on
the candidate's append-only local chain; they do not qualify future fork choice.

## Rules and limits

See [the frozen candidate specification](../../docs/research/REGIONAL_LEDGER_CANDIDATE_V1.md).
The fixture campaign issues 300 **runlai units**, not 300 RLD, in three origin
rewards after a zero-allocation genesis. Every other region issues zero.
Split/merge, multiple-owner inputs, explicit change and both local and destination
fees are integer-only. Export inputs require locally finalized creation history;
imported assets require local maturity and finality before onward export. A
return is a new export and import, with a new ID; no timeout or receipt refund
exists. Fees become explicit local outputs and never disappear from accounting.

Per store: 256 blocks, 64 retained snapshots, 4,096 coins/exports/import IDs and
8 MiB journal/evidence; per block 16 commands, per spend 16 inputs/outputs.
Limits reject new work and retain accepted evidence. There is no pruning.

The append-only chain has fixed cheap fixture PoW (one leading zero hash byte),
no timestamps, fork-choice or retargeting. Default node startup now enables the supplemental contact service. Four public
keys sign a monotonic checkpoint; separately locked signing agents persist before
releasing signatures and require caller-retained latest heads. Joint four-old plus
four-new handoffs fence validator eras without changing balances. There are no
BFT view changes or missing-signer liveness guarantees. Authenticated forks,
incompatible joint handoffs and old-era certificates past a closing fence are
durably retained and quarantine new related operations. Repair never unfreezes.
Consensus incident resolution, independent recovery/custody, channels, live wallet,
qualified real adapters, radio/BPv7 integration, independent archives and crypto
algorithm eras remain open. A surviving external latest signer head detects stale
signer backups; restoring all heads/state together or bypassing agents with copied
keys defeats that protection. An old complete ledger journal still replays as old
state without an external latest-state anchor. At most 16 validator handoffs and
128 signer requests are retained. See the new specification for exact assumptions.
Fsync/rename and an exclusive OS lock protect local commits, not hostile local
filesystem writers or arbitrary storage hardware. These remaining gates cannot
be replaced by the campaign's successful result.

## Encrypted keys and complete owner backup

Use a private absolute parent directory (owned, mode 0700). Every command below
also needs the existing `--dir LEDGER --authority AUTHORITY --currency CURRENCY`
global pins. Passwords are read from an echo-free local terminal, never arguments
or environment. For private automation, `--passphrase-stdin` reads exact UTF-8
bytes (12–1024, without newline/controls) from a bounded pipe. Never echo a real
password in a shell command or place private files in a publication directory.

```sh
rld-regional-ledger-candidate GLOBAL_PINS wallet-key-create --output /private/owner.enc.json
rld-regional-ledger-candidate GLOBAL_PINS wallet-init --owner RETURNED_PUBLIC_KEY --wallet-dir /private/wallet
rld-regional-ledger-candidate GLOBAL_PINS wallet-app --wallet-dir /private/wallet --head-dir /private/caller-head --owner PUBLIC_KEY --expected-wallet-head LATEST_HEAD --encrypted-key /private/owner.enc.json --backup-dir /private/backups
rld-regional-ledger-candidate GLOBAL_PINS wallet-backup --wallet-dir /private/wallet --expected-wallet-head LATEST_HEAD --encrypted-key /private/owner.enc.json --output /private/backups/new.enc.json
rld-regional-ledger-candidate GLOBAL_PINS wallet-restore --file /private/backups/new.enc.json --wallet-dir /private/NEW-wallet --expected-wallet-head SEPARATELY_RETAINED_LATEST_HEAD
```

`GLOBAL_PINS` is a placeholder for the three explicit global options above,
not a shell variable or implicit trust source. Creation returns only the pinned
currency/region/new public owner and never issues or funds assets. New signing
uses `wallet-sign --encrypted-key ...`; explicit legacy `--key-file` remains for
public fixtures and has no automatic fallback. `--recover-only` and exact stored
retries never unlock/read a key or first-sign. The wallet-app unlock requires a
local terminal; HTTP never accepts a passphrase/key/backup path.

The versioned envelope authenticates purpose, currency/region/owner, algorithm,
KDF parameters, salt and nonce. Fixed Argon2id v19 (64 MiB, t=3, p=4, 32-byte key,
16-byte random salt) follows the second configuration in
[RFC 9106](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9106.html); AES-256-GCM uses random
12-byte nonces and 16-byte tags. Seeds, derived keys, plaintext buffers and KDF
memory use zeroization; AES key schedules enable zeroization. This does not
prove runtime/OS memory erasure, password entropy or independent security.

Backup includes the key, complete validated private owner journal, exact head
and current native history/finality/era/incident observation. Restoring requires
a **separately retained latest head**, compatible native replay and a fresh
wallet directory. It preserves original creation/history, partial consent and
only-owned reservations, writes `key.enc.json`, and refuses overwrite. It does
not restore/replace a caller-head directory or approve unresolved clicked
pending operations. A remaining `RESTORING` marker forbids opening/signing; keep
that failed target and restore the original backup into another fresh directory.
Encrypted files require owned private parent/file permissions, no symlinks or
multiple hardlinks, and bounded size. Every successful new signature needs an
updated backup and latest head; the UI clears its prior backup result on change.

A copied key plus rollback of all journals/heads remains unqualified. Hardware
custody, independent anti-rollback/security review, reorganization/cross-device
recovery, a complete sustained wallet product and stellar crypto remain required.
No real asset migration or I1–I12 completion is claimed. Reproduce the ground
CLI/HTTP checks with `python -m unittest discover -s tools -p test_regional_wallet_custody.py`; the bundled
transport Python/dependencies are still required.
